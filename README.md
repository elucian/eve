<p>Eve is a domain specific scripting language for data processing and test automation. Eve is open source with Apache 2.0 license. We design the language and we create code examples in this repository. This language is a standard. It will have many interpreters and compilers implemented by diverse other organizations.</p>

  
## Learning

You can learn Eve on our website. After you learn the syntax you can start contributing. We design Eve for learning. We should add examples that demonstrate how we can use Eve for teaching programming concepts, algorithms and data structures.

## Testing

Our next priority is to create a "conformity test". This require test automation for future compilers. Our job is to create the standard examples required for testing. We write test first (TDD). In the future will be probable many interpreters and compilers that can be verified using these tests.
  
## Contribution

You can contribute in 2 ways: First you can open discussions. Second, you can open and resolve work items. You signal an error and you assign yourself to solve it. Then you solve it and commit your code or make a PR. If you have direct access on Eve repository you should create a developement branch. When a feature is ready, merge the code into main branch and signal on Discord. We will publish your changes.

# MD Docs

We are working on a new documentation that use MD files. This documentation will be specific to EVE virtual machine hosted in this repository. Every other compiler will need specific documentation with refference to ths original documentation.

Open: [Eve MD Docs](docs/index.md)

You can contribute to this documentation. Connect to Eve User Manual and reverse engineer the original documentation. Then add technical details and expand the concepts. Connect with examples of code and test use-cases.
