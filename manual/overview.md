## Punctuation

* EVE is using infix expressions like Java and other popular languages;
* Multiple expressions can be separated with comma and enclosed in parenthesis;
* Each statement start with a lowercase keyword and is ending at end of line; 
* Local identifiers use lowercase letters and numbers;
* Public members start with one capital letter, can contain lowercase letters and digits;
* System environment variables use prefix "$". These are global constants in Bee; 
* System constants use prefix "$" and can start with uppercase if they are also public;
* System variables use prefix "#" and can start with uppercase if they are also public;
* References types use prefix "@" and can start with uppercase if they are also public;
* Scoping operator is "." not "::". You can use alias or module name as scope qualifier;

## Comments

* Title comment is using ## two hashes like Wiki pages
* Sub-title comment and line separators are using: "**"
* End of line comment can be done using "--"
* Boxed comments are using notation "+-...-+"
* Outline comments are using pair "|* ... *|"

**examples**
```
*************************************
**  Boxed comments using: "**"     **
*************************************

## Title comment
  ** indented comment

** Single line comment
print; 
+------------------------------------
|  fancy boxed comments to explain  |
|  code, can span multiple lines    |
------------------------------------+

```

**Notes:**
* Nested comments are supported for out-line comments;
* End of line comments are ending after new line;

## Attributes
One module can have multiple attributes usually declared at beginning of the module. Attributes start with ".". 

**examples**
```
module
  .name := :='test'
  .description :='test'
```

**note:** You can define new attributes.

## Keywords

Keywords are English reserved words used in statements. Computer was invented in England during WW2 so, we prefer English words even though a computer language could be created using keywords from other spoken languages.

Summary: [Keywords](keywords.md) 

## Operators

EVE us ASCII symbols for operators. One operator can be a single character or a combination of two characters. 

Single character:
```
{ = : ~ ! @ % ^ & * - + / < >}
```
Two characters:
```
{ := :: != <> => >= <= +> <+ <: .. }
```
Delimiters:
```
, : . ; "" '' 
( ) [ ] { } 
```

Details: [Operators](operators.md) 

## Data type

Data type is an abstract concept that describe data representation. 

There are 3 kind of data types in EVE:

* [basic types](basic.md)
* [composite types](composite.md)
* [classes](classes.md)

## Variables
A variable is represented by an identifier, and is associated to a type. Variables can be changed during the execution of the program using modifier operators { :=, +=, *=, /= ...}. Variables are abstract concepts can can represent memory locations or values that can be moved around in different memory locations or processor registry.

**patterns:**
```
** user can define a type
type type_name[parameters] <: type_descriptor;

global
  ** use type to define a variable
  type_name: var_name;
  ** with specific value and type
  type_name: var_name := value;
  ** multiple variables in one assignment
  type_name: var_name1, name2 ...:= value;
  ** multiple variables with diverse values
  type_name: var_name1:=value1, var_name2 := value2;
```

**examples**
```
global  
  ** integer numbers
  Integer: a;
  Integer: b := 1;

  ** real numbers
  Real: d := 2.5;
  Real: x,y,z := 0.0;
```

**default value**
When a variable is specified, and the initializer ":=" is missing the variable takes default zero value. This value is different for each data type. For example zero value for Real: numbers is 0.0 and for strings is "". 

## System variables
We define system variables using "$" name prefix. _Environment Variables_ from OS are created automatically along with other "implicit" variables required by EVE semantics. 

## Assign Value 
The assign operator ":=" is used to execute an expression and assign the result to a variable.  
The previous value of the variable is discarded if there is no other reference to it.  

**Syntax:**
```
  variable_name := expression 
```

## Identifiers
The name of identifiers in EVE can have a length of 64 characters. A name starts with lowercase letters (a..z) or capital letters (A..Z) followed by one or more characters or numbers. No special characters or spaces are permitted in the name except underscore ("_"). A variable can contain underscore but can not start or with underscore. 

**These are valid identifiers**  
```
 x, y, z
 a1,a2,a3  
 thisIsOK
 this_is_ok  
```
**These are invalid identifiers**  
```
 1st
 \_not_valid  
 not_valid\_  
 \_not_valid\_  
```

**Prefix**
System variables, system constants and composite types are using a prefix.

* "$"  is for system constants/ environment variables;
* "#"  is for system variables/ control variables;
* "@"  is for reference type or composite type;

**notes:**
* Prefix is improving color coding convention for new types;
* Prefix is reducing collision between local and global names;
* In other languages this kind of prefix is called _sigil_;

## Expressions

Expressions are created using identifiers, operators, functions and constant literals. 

* can be combined to create more complex expressions;
* have a type that is calculated using type inference;
* can be assigned to variables using ":=" or "<+" operators;
* can be printed to console using "print" or "write" methods;
* can use () to establish order of operations;

**Examples**
```
** simple expressions in print statement
print  10; 
print "this is a test";

** complex expressions can use ()  
print (10 + 10 + 15);     -- numeric expression
print (10 > 5) | (2 < 3); -- logical expression

** list of expressions are enclosed in ()
print (1, 2, 3);    -- expect: 1 2 3
print (10, 11, 12); -- expect: 10 11 12

** using write to: avoid new line and print
write (1,2);
write (3,4);  

** now create a new line
print; -- 1234 
```

**Notes:** 
* print statement can receive multiple arguments in parenthesis ()
* print statement add new line by default
* print statement will separate different values using one space 
* to avoid new line you can use "write" statement instead of "print"

## Statements

One statement can be declarative or imperative. 

* A statement is usually a line of code source terminated with new line
* Sometimes a statement extend on several lines
* Sometimes multiple statements are in the same line, separated by ";"
* A group of several statements is called a block of code
* A block of code usually is terminated by one final keyword and ";"
* The final keyword is different for different statements;

**examples**

The most simple block statement start with "begin" and end with "done"
```
given
  ** integer numbers
  Integer: a := 0;
  Real:    b := 1.5; 
begin
  print  (a, b);
  expect (a = 0, b = 1.5);
done;
```

## Multiple lines

One expression can span multiple lines. 

* The expression may be enclosed in parenthesis or quotation marks; 
* Arithmetic expressions can use an operator to continue on next line;


**example**
```
given 
  Integer: x; 
 @Matrix : a; 
begin  
  ** multi-row expression
  x := 1 + 2 +
       3 + 4 + 5;

  ** ERROR: â†“ (missing ";") 
  x := 1 + 2 
     + 3 + 4 + 5;
       
  ** all 5 numbers are in 
  expect x = 15; 

  ** multi-row matrix
  a := [ 
         [1,2],
         [3,4],
         [5,6]
       ];
done;
```
