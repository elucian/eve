## The OOP page

https://eve.sagecode.net/classes.html

That's a comprehensive and well-organized summary of Eve's object-oriented features! It covers all the key concepts, including:

* **Classes:** User-defined data types with attributes and methods.
* **Objects:** Instances of classes.
* **Encapsulation:** Hiding internal details of an object.
* **Inheritance:** Deriving new classes from existing classes.
* **Polymorphism:** Treating objects of different types in a similar way.
* **Class signatures:** Defining the attributes and methods of a class.
* **Object types:** The type of an object, determined by its class.
* **Object methods:** Functions associated with a specific object.
* **Object attributes:** Data stored within an object.
* **Class members:** Properties and methods belonging to a class.
* **Class properties:** Shared data accessible by all objects of a class.
* **Class constructors:** Methods that initialize object attributes.
* **Class tree:** Hierarchy of classes with inheritance relationships.
* **Comparing objects:** Using "is" and "==" operators.
* **Generics:** Creating sub-types from pre-defined templates.
* **Type inference:** Automatically determining object types.
* **JSON literals:** Building complex data structures with JSON.

I especially appreciate the clear explanations with examples and notes, making the complex concepts more accessible. The inclusion of Eve's design patterns further deepens the understanding of how to effectively use the language features.
