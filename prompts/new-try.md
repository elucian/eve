## Comprehensive Design for Error Handling and Multiple Jobs in Eve

**Goals:**

* Handle different types of errors gracefully and informatively.
* Allow for independent execution of multiple jobs within a process.
* Provide flexibility in error response based on severity and context.
* Maintain code clarity and resource management.

**Design Components:**

1. **Error Types:**
    * Define custom error types (e.g., `DatabaseError`, `ValidationFailed`) to categorize errors.
    * Use descriptive error messages to pinpoint the issue.
    * Implement a hierarchy of error types for general and specific handling.

2. **Job Structure:**
    * Utilize labelled `process` or `routine` blocks for overall process flow.
    * Define individual `job` blocks for independent tasks within the process.
    * Each job can have its own nested `try` and `catch` blocks for granular error handling.

3. **Error Handling:**
    * Use `try` blocks within jobs to attempt operations.
    * Employ `catch` blocks with specific error types for targeted responses.
        * `exit`: terminate the job and continue to next job (non-critical errors).
        * `retry`: re-attempt the operation within the job (reversible errors).
        * `pass`: ignore the error and continue (non-blocking errors).
        * `fail`: mark the job as failed and continue to next job (critical but recoverable errors).
        * `raise`: throw the error to the `recover` block for broader handling (unhandled errors).

4. **Recovery and Finalization:**
    * Implement a dedicated `recover` block to handle unhandled errors thrown from jobs.
        * This can involve logging errors, notifying administrators, or initiating fallback procedures.
    * Utilize a separate `finalize` block to:
        * Close resources regardless of success or failure.
        * Report job execution status (success, failure, retry count).
        * Clean up temporary data or resources.

**Table of Keywords:**

| Keyword | Description |
|---|---|
| `process` | Defines the overall flow of execution. |
| `routine` | Similar to `process` but can be reused. |
| `job` | Defines a specific task within a process. |
| `try` | Attempts an operation within a job. |
| `catch` | Handles specific error types within a `try` block. |
| `raise` | Throws an unhandled error to the `recover` block. |
| `exit` | Terminates the current job and continues to next job. |
| `retry` | Re-attempts the operation within the current job. |
| `pass` | Ignores the error and continues the current job. |
| `fail` | Marks the job as failed and continues to next job. |
| `recover` | Handles unhandled errors thrown from jobs. |
| `finalize` | Closes resources, reports job status, and cleans up. |

**Example Code:**

```eve
# Define custom error types
error DatabaseError: "Error communicating with database.";
error ValidationFailed: "Data entry did not pass validation.";

# Main process
process update_records():
  # Job 1: Fetch records
  job (c1, "Fetch data") try
    new records := table_name.find(filter: ...);
    if records.count == 0 then
      raise DatabaseError("No records found.");
  catch DatabaseError then
    print("Database error fetching records.");
    # Retry the job
    retry;

  # Job 2: Update records
  job (c2, "Update values") try
    for record in records loop
      record.update(field: "value");
      if record.has_error then
        raise ValidationFailed("Record validation failed.");
  catch ValidationFailed then
    print("Record validation errors, some updates skipped.");

  # Finalize: report and clean up
  finalize
    print("Updated", records.count, "records.");
    close_database_connection();

return;
```

This example showcases how the design components combine to handle errors in different jobs and provide informative responses. Remember to adapt and customize this design to your specific needs and error handling requirements for optimal results in your Eve project.

Feel free to ask any questions or share your specific scenarios for further guidance on implementing this design in your code.


----

I agree, your improved design is excellent! It incorporates the key suggestions from our previous discussion and demonstrates a clear, well-structured approach to error handling in Eve. Here's what I particularly like about it:

* **Job-specific `try` blocks:** This provides targeted error handling within each job, making it easier to identify and address issues.
* **Custom error types:** `DatabaseError` and `ValidationFailed` provide informative messages and context for different error scenarios.
* **Explicit error handling within `catch` blocks:** This avoids silent failures and allows for specific actions based on the error type.
* **`retry` on database errors:** This is a good strategy for handling transient database issues without disrupting the entire process.
* **`finalize` block for reporting and cleanup:** This ensures resource management even if errors occur.

Overall, your design balances clarity, control, and robustness, making it a valuable tool for building reliable and maintainable Eve applications.

## Improved Error Handling System in Eve

**Purpose:**

This system aims to provide a structured and flexible approach to error handling in Eve applications, fostering clarity, control, and resilience. It builds upon existing Eve features and offers several key improvements:

* **Custom error types:** Defining specific error types like `ValidationError` or `NetworkError` allows for informative messages and targeted handling.
* **Hierarchical error handling:** Implementing a hierarchy of error types enables general recovery mechanisms for common errors and specific responses for more critical ones.
* **Job-based error handling:** Using separate `try` blocks for each job within a process allows for granular control and error isolation.
* **Dedicated `recover` block:** This section handles uncaught errors from jobs, providing an additional layer of safety and flexibility.
* **Clear syntax:** The system leverages existing Eve syntax with minor extensions for custom error types and hierarchical handling.

**BNF Syntax:**

* **`process`:** defines the main process flow.
* **`job (c, "description")`:** defines a specific task within the process, with `c` being a unique identifier and "description" providing context.
* **`try`:** attempts an operation within a job or the main process.
* **`catch $error type`:** handles specific error types thrown within the `try` block.
* **`raise error_type`:** throws a custom error type within a `try` block.
* **`retry`:** re-attempts the current operation within a job.
* **`exit`:** terminates the current job and continues to the next one.
* **`recover $error type`:** handles uncaught errors thrown from jobs.
* **`finalize`:** executes cleanup and reporting tasks after the process finishes.

**Simple Design Example (without jobs):**

```eve
process update_data():
  try
    open_database();
    data.update(field: "value");
  catch DatabaseError then
    print("Database error:", $error.message);
  finally
    close_database();

return;
```

**Complex Design Example (with multiple jobs and `recover`):**

```eve
process process_orders():
  # Job 1: Fetch orders
  job (c1, "Fetch orders") try
    orders := get_orders();
  catch OrderNotFoundError then
    print("No orders found.");
    # Skip to finalize

  # Job 2: Process orders
  job (c2, "Process orders") try
    for order in orders loop
      process_order(order);
    end loop;
  end try;

  recover OrderProcessingError then
    print("Order processing error:", $error.message);

  finalize
    close_resources();
    report_status(orders);

return;
```

**Keywords:**

* `process`, `job`, `try`, `catch`, `raise`, `retry`, `exit`, `recover`, `finalize`

**Advantages:**

* **Clear and structured:** Improves code readability and maintainability.
* **Flexible and adaptable:** Allows customization to specific needs.
* **Informative error handling:** Provides context and targeted responses.
* **Controlled termination:** Prevents program crashes from unexpected errors.
* **Resource management:** Ensures cleanup regardless of success or failure.

**Overall, this improved system offers a powerful and versatile tool for building robust and reliable Eve applications. Feel free to adapt it to your specific use cases and leverage its strengths to create well-managed and resilient applications.**
