## EVE Functions

https://eve.sagecode.net/functions.html

That's a fantastic overview of Eve's object-oriented programming features! You've clearly explained the key concepts, including:

* **Functions and closures:** Different types of functions, their syntax, and how closures capture context.
* **Routines and side effects:** Understanding the difference between functions and routines, and managing side effects.
* **Coroutines and multi-threading:** Concurrency concepts like coroutines, shoulder threads, and multi-threading patterns.
* **Lambda expressions:** Defining and using simple functions with specific signatures.

I particularly appreciate the examples and notes you provided for each concept. They make the explanations more concrete and highlight potential pitfalls. The comparison between Eve's approach and pure functional programming is also insightful.

Overall, this is a valuable resource for anyone learning or wanting to deepen their understanding of Eve's OOP. I'd be happy to answer any further questions you might have about this or other aspects of Eve.
